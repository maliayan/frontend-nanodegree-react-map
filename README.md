# Neighborhood Map: React + Google Maps + Foursquare Places API

## About this Project

This is my submission for the capstone project of "Google Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program". This project includes an web app which shows my favorite venues in Moda, Kadikoy, Istanbul.

* I created this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* Then I used [React Google Maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps) to integrate Google Maps to my project.
* Lastly, I added one sample photo for each venue which is provided by [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api) and is implemented with [React Foursquare](https://github.com/foursquare/react-foursquare).

## Instructions

To install and launch the project:

* clone the repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
